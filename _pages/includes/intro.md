Hi, I'm a master student in  [Learning and Vision Lab, NUS](http://www.lv-nus.org/) from Sep. 2023, and fortunate to be advised by [Prof.Xinchao Wang](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/ece/staff/wang-xinchao/).

Previously, I obtained my Bachelorâ€™s degree from the College of Software at Sichuan University and was advised by Dr. [Zhiyang Fang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=q0A9O6oAAAAJ). 

Now I'm working in the area of controllable 2D/3D generation.
